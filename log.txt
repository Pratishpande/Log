-->1)Tried  running first program in keiluvision , unable to run due to following errors.

    ----->systick timer was not enabled

    ----->sytick timer priority was weak ,so we need to explicitly declare to enable the delay.

    ----->declare variable as volatile or do o0 in c compiler setting if not done value of variable will not get updated

    ----->In initialization we have to also write HAL_INIT().

-->2)After all this correction able to write first code for blinking led in keil
