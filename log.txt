Time:10:00 pm

-->1)Installation of keiluvision and stm32 libraries
-->2)Creating Repositories in Git-hub for project


Date:30/8/2021
Time:11:00 pm

-->1)Tried  running first program in keiluvision , unable to run due to following errors.

    ----->systick timer was not enabled

    ----->sytick timer priority was weak ,so we need to explicitly declare to enable the delay.

    ----->declare variable as volatile or do o0 in c compiler setting if not done value of variable will not get updated

    ----->In initialization we have to also write HAL_INIT().

-->2)After all this correction able to write first code for blinking led in keil

Time:11:00 pm


-->1)Read documents about linux boot loading and boot sequence for an ARM

------------->https://www.embeddedrelated.com/showarticle/124.php

------------->https://embeddedbuddies555.wordpress.com/2020/03/29/linux-booting-process-on-arm-processor/

-->2)Connected ESP32 to wifi with using mqtt protocol

-->3)Started with adc single shot conversion program in keil



Date:1/9/2021
Time:11:00 pm


-->1)Connected ESP32 to thingsboard.io free source cloud

-->2)Completed with adc single shot conversion program in keil

     --->Watched adc value in debug session by clicking on enable (blue button) continously and clicking on reset(black button)

-->Problem faced
      
     --->Do not stop adc after starting it for enable button.



Date:2/9/2021
Time:11:00 pm

-->1)Moisture sensor working on arduino nano


Date:6/9/2021
Time:11:00 pm

-->1)Interfacing of sensor wih STM32F407VG using CUBEMX BY using ADC Timer trigger code

-->2)Started same code with keil.

-->3)Started with Interfacing of stm32 with esp32.
   

Date:10/9/2021
Time:11:00 pm

--->1)Done with building of  cross-compiler toolchain for beaglebone 

Date:25/9/2021
Time:11:00 pm

--->1)Done with interfacing moisture sensor and succesfully reading data with adc timer trigger.

      ---->Problems faced
        ----->1)we have to explicitly write Hal_MspInit() function for system clock configuration otherwise it 
                will not work.
        ----->2)Found out problem form adc driver file and cross-referenced with cube mx stm32f4xx_msp.c file.


--->2)started with Uart transmission.


Date:26/9/2021
Time:11:00 pm

--->1)Done with Uart_transmission of Data to ESP32

----->Problems faced
    ---->1)We cannot directly send int data using uart transmission hal api because we can only send 1 byte of character data
      
       ---> Declare a character buffer.
       ---> Data needs to be converted from int to character so we use sprintf function which stores int value as formated series of characters and values in char buffer.
      
 ---> Do not send directly int value , first take char variable and give it numerical value eg.65, it will print ascii value of 'A'.
 ---> Do not use 10 or value whose asci value is /n,/t or /r.
  ---> Then take char buffer and give a string eg.Hello World and try print it on Putty.
    --->This all methods are done to check whether connections are write and uart transmission is working.

Date:27/9/2021
Time:11:00 pm

--->1)Started with serial reading of data from Esp32 send by STM32F4xx

--->2)Need to check proper connections before sending and must be common grounded

--->3)On arduino website api for Uart for transmission and Reception is given or below Youtube videos reference is good
                    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CQNLu5OfT8

--->4)we also can refer to github code of below link
                   https://github.com/G6EJD/ESP32_Serial_Port_Examples
         
--->5)First try to send and receive on Esp32 in loopback mode sending from 1 Uart to another Uartreceiver if it works successfully then move on to next step

--->6)Succesfully send data from STM32F4xx and Receive data on Esp32 and displayed on Serial monitor

Note : Check The Baud Rate and Transmisson pins.


Date:28/9/2021
Time:11:00 pm

--->1)Started with transmission of data on mqtt broker by using mqtt protocol.

--->Library to be installed
  --->1)PubSubClient and WiFi 

--->2)Successfully completed data transmission with mqtt protocol using node-red


Date:29/9/2021

--->1)Started the project with  FreeRTOS in cube mx .

---->2)Babu Sir notes on RTOS.

----->3)Documents to be read are given below

------>1)Mastering_The_FreeRTOS_Real_Time_Kernel_A_Hands_on_Tutorial_Guide

------>2)FreeRTOS_Reference_Manual_v9.0.0 and above recomended

----->4)Started first with adc_timer trigger and successfully completed by creating a task and scheduling it.
